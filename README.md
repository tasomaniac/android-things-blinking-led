Android Things Blinking Led
===========================

Based on [Android Things empty project template](https://github.com/androidthings/new-project-template). 

I wanted to start with this template to demonstrate how easy it is to start with a new IoT project with Android Things.


Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android Things compatible board
- Android Studio 2.2+


Build and install
=================

On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

The project uses Novoda's [gradle-android-command-plugin](https://github.com/novoda/gradle-android-command-plugin). If you prefer to run on the command line, type

```bash
./gradlew runDebug
```
